# Functions/event_store/conflict_queue.py
#
# FIFO conflict queue for the JML event store.
# Handles ordering when a new event arrives for an identity that already
# has an active event in progress.
#
# Rules:
#   Active event exists       → new event queued (Status: Pending, QueuedAt set)
#   Previous event Completed  → next Pending event released automatically
#   Previous event Failed     → next Pending event held for human review
#   Leaver arrives            → all Pending events superseded, Leaver claims immediately
#
# This file handles ordering logic only.
# All persistence operations delegate to event_store.py.
