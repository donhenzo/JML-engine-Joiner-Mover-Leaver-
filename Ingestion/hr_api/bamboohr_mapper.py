BambooHR Field Mapper

Responsibility: translate BambooHR API field names to the JML engine's
raw identity field shape. That is all this module does.

Output is intentionally raw — field values are NOT normalised here.
The existing Normalization/normalizer.py handles canonical resolution.

Separation of concerns:
    bamboohr_client.py  → knows BambooHR's API
    bamboohr_mapper.py  → knows the field name translation (this file)
    normalizer.py       → knows canonical values
    action_deriver.py   → knows Joiner vs Mover vs Leaver

Two IDs exist in BambooHR:
    id              → BambooHR's internal auto-assigned numeric ID (used for API calls)
    employeeNumber  → the HR-meaningful ID set by the organisation (e.g. "Acc001")

The JML engine uses employeeNumber as employee_id because:
    - It is the ID HR teams know and use
    - It appears on payslips, contracts, and org charts
    - It is portable across HR systems (if you switch from BambooHR, the employee number stays)
    - The EventId hash (SHA-256 of EmployeeId + Action + StartDate) must use the stable HR ID

The BambooHR internal id is kept as bamboohr_id so the fetcher can still make API calls
when needed (e.g. delta poll returns an internal ID, fetcher needs it for the URL).

BambooHR field         → IdentityPayload field
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
employeeNumber         → employee_id (HR-meaningful)
id                     → bamboohr_id (API-internal, not in IdentityPayload)
firstName + lastName   → display_name
workEmail              → upn
department             → department (raw)
jobTitle               → job_title (raw)
employmentHistoryStatus → employment_type (raw, e.g. "Full-Time")
hireDate               → start_date
supervisorEId          → manager_id
location               → location (raw)

    """
    Translate a single BambooHR employee record into the raw identity
    shape the JML pipeline expects.

    Does NOT set the 'action' field — that is determined by the
    action deriver after the fetch and map steps complete.

    Args:
        bamboohr_record: raw dict from bamboohr_client.get_employee()

    Returns:
        dict matching the raw IdentityPayload field structure.
        Null/missing BambooHR fields become empty strings — the
        normaliser will catch these and route to the hold queue.

        Also includes 'bamboohr_id' for API lookups — this field

        the record enters the pipeline.
