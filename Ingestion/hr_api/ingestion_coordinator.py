"""
Ingestion Coordinator

Responsibility: wire the HR API fetcher, mapper, action deriver, and
JML pipeline together. This is the single entry point for all HR-driven
ingestion modes.

Three modes, one atomic unit:
    run_single(bamboohr_id)  → fetch one employee, derive action, run pipeline
    run_delta()              → poll for changes since last checkpoint, run each
    run_bulk(bamboohr_ids)   → process a confirmed list, run each

Every mode ultimately calls run_single(). The other two are just different
ways of deciding which employee IDs to process.

Idempotency is NOT enforced here — it is enforced downstream in the event
store via claim_event(). This module's job is to get the right records to
the pipeline in the right shape. The pipeline handles the rest.

Separation of concerns:
    bamboohr_client.py        → knows BambooHR's API
    bamboohr_mapper.py        → translates field names
    action_deriver.py         → determines Joiner / Mover / Skip
    system_state.py           → tracks last poll timestamp
    pipeline_adapter.py       → bridges HR API records to the existing pipeline
    ingestion_coordinator.py  → orchestrates all of the above (this file)
